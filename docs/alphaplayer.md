# Alpha Player

**Alpha Player** is a multimedia core for RePlay OS, based on a port of the powerful FFmpeg audio/video decoding library to the libretro platform. This allows seamless playback of a wide variety of audio and video formats, along with advanced features like audio visualizations and smooth interframe blending for non-native framerates.

* **Audio Visualizer:** Displays a real-time FFT-based audio visualizer when playing music.
* **Interframe Blending:** Enables smoother playback for videos with non-native framerates.
