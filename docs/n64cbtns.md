# N64 C-Buttons (User Guide)

## How C-Buttons Are Mapped?

N64 has four C-buttons (C-Up, C-Down, C-Left, C-Right). Our controls support them in two user-friendly ways, and you can use either (or both) depending on your controller and the game.

## Right Stick = C-Buttons (Recommended)

- Move the right stick to press C-Left/Right/Up/Down.
- This is always available and doesn’t require any mode switch.
- The stick only triggers when pushed past a small threshold (to avoid accidental presses).
- Best for: camera control (Mario 64), item selection (Ocarina of Time), quick aim/camera nudges.

## Button-Based C-Buttons (Two Presets)

### A) “Hold R2 for C-Buttons” (Default)
This is a momentary mode:

- Normal (R2 not held): face buttons act as A/B (for normal gameplay).
- C-Mode (hold R2): face buttons temporarily become C-Up/Down/Left/Right.
- Release R2 to instantly return to normal A/B.
- Default C-mode layout (while holding R2) is the familiar diamond:

    - South face = C-Down
    - West face = C-Left
    - East face = C-Right
    - North face = C-Up

You can customize C-mode if your controller layout feels different:

- Set which face button becomes C-Right / C-Left / C-Down / C-Up while holding R2.
- Best for: controllers where you want to keep A/B simple, and only need C-buttons sometimes.

### B) “Independent C-Buttons” (No Mode Switch) 
This is an always-on layout:

- Requires enabling Independent C-Button Controls from `SYSTEM SETTINGS > PAK/CONTROLLER OPTIONS`
- C-buttons are placed on dedicated controls (so you don’t need to hold R2).
- Typical layout:
    - L1/R1 = C-Left / C-Right
    - North/East face = C-Up / C-Down
- A/B remain on their usual face buttons.
- Best for: games that use C-buttons constantly, or for players who dislike holding a modifier.

## Which Should I Choose?

- If you have a good right stick: use Right Stick = C-buttons.
- If you want minimal changes and a simple “temporary C” layer: use Hold R2 for C-buttons.
- If you want C-buttons always available without holding anything: use Independent C-buttons.
