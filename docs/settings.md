| Audio Sample Rate (Hz) | picodrive_sound_rate | Higher values increase sound quality. Lower values may increase performance. Native is the Megadrive sound chip rate (~53000). Select this if you want the most accurate audio. |
| FM filtering | picodrive_fm_filter | Enable filtering for Mega Drive FM sound at non-native bitrates. Sound output will improve, at the price of being noticeably slower |
| Master System FM Sound Unit | picodrive_smsfm | Enable emulation of the SMS FM Sound Unit. This produces higher quality audio in some games, but non-Japanese titles may fail to run. |
| Mega Drive FM DAC noise | picodrive_dacnoise | Enable emulation of YM2612 DAC noise. This option generates a distortion which existed on most Model 1 Mega Drive/Genesis, but not on newer models. |
| Audio Filter | picodrive_audio_filter | Enable a low pass audio filter to better simulate the characteristic sound of a Model 1 Mega Drive/Genesis. Note that only Model 1 and its add-ons (Sega CD, 32X) employed a physical low pass filter. |
| Low-Pass Filter % | picodrive_lowpass_range | Specify the cut-off frequency of the low pass audio filter. A higher value increases the perceived 'strength' of the filter, since a wider range of the high frequency spectrum is attenuated. |
| Input Device 1 | picodrive_input1 | Choose which type of controller is plugged into slot 1. Note that a multiplayer adaptor uses both slots. |
| Input Device 2 | picodrive_input2 | Choose which type of controller is plugged into slot 2. This setting is ignored when a multiplayer adaptor is plugged into slot 1. |
| Dynamic Recompilers | picodrive_drc | Enable dynamic recompilers which help to improve performance. Less accurate than interpreter CPU cores, but significantly faster. |
| No Sprite Limit | picodrive_sprlim | Removes the original sprite-per-scanline hardware limit. This reduces flickering but can cause visual glitches, as some games exploit the hardware limit to generate special effects. |
| 68K Overclock | picodrive_overclk68k | Overclock the emulated 68K chip. Can reduce slowdown, but may cause glitches. |

| PGXP Depth Buffer | swanstation_GPU_PGXPDepthBuffer | Attempts to reduce polygon Z-fighting by testing pixels against the depth values from PGXP. Low compatibility, but can work well in some games. Requires geometry correction enabled. |
| PGXP Vertex Cache | swanstation_GPU_PGXPVertexCache | Uses screen coordinates as a fallback when tracking vertices through memory fails. May improve PGXP compatibility. |
| PGXP CPU Mode | swanstation_GPU_PGXPCPU | Tries to track vertex manipulation through the CPU. Some games require this option for PGXP to be effective. Very slow, and incompatible with the recompiler. |
| PGXP Preserve Projection Precision | swanstation_GPU_PGXPPreserveProjFP | Enables additional precision for PGXP. May improve visuals in some games but break others. |
| PGXP Geometry Tolerance | swanstation_GPU_PGXPTolerance | Ignores precise positions if the difference exceeds this threshold. |
